Notebooks 1, NorthAnalysis, 2, and 3 handle finding and analyzing clouds. Other notebooks handle analyzing CO and image convolution. Running the code if you have the data will create many csv and fits files, so make sure you have disc space available. This does not contain the necessary fits files to run the code, this repo is purely for documentation purposes.
